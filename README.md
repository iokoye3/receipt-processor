Receipt processor:

-Sorry for the delay!
-Used Spring Boot (Dockerfile is included)
-Receipt and Item objects contain their variables as well as getters and setters
-Sample JSONs were used for testing
-Used Postman to test API endpoints
-Both sample receipts return the correct number of points
-UUID was easiest way to create an ID
